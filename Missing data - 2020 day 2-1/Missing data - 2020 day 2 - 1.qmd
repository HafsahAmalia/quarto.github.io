## Recap

- Why should we worry about missing data?

    - Ignoring missing data (complete/available case analysis) looses power (always) and introduces bias (in non-MCAR situations)
    - Ad hoc methods such as (subgroup)mean cause bias and may affect both power and type I error
    - The missing indicator method gives biased estimates

More advanced methods are needed!

## Methods to handle missing data	

Complete case analysis (CC)

Available case analysis (AC)

Missing indicator method

Overall mean/median imputation

Subgroup mean/median imputation

**Single (multivariable) regression based imputation**

**Multiple regression based imputation**

## Univariate missing data

Consider we have one variable with missing observations for some participants.

## Single imputation by regression

- Develop a prediction model to predict the missing values based on the observed data

    - Include the outcome (!) of the analysis model
    - Include all variables of the analysis model
    - Include yet (!) unknown predictors of the missing value

- Imputation model is used to estimate for each subject with missing <span style="color:blue;">cvd</span> its actual value, given all other predictor (including outcome) values 

- This is also called the imputation model
