## Topics

**Aim of this talk**: to illustrate potential role of a data scientist

- What is data science?
- Data Science in Healthcare
- Example studies in COVID-19
- Typical projects
- Tools for data science (Phyton, RStudio, and MySQL)

## What is Data Science?

Data science is an umbrella term commonly used to describe the process for **extracting information from data**. Data scientists typically engage in:

- Data preparation (e.g., extraction, linkage, cleaning, etc.)
- Data Analysis (e.g., statistics, machine learning)
- Data Visualization (e.g., charts, forest plots, etc.)
- Automation (e.g., development of software, dashboards, etc.)

## Data Science in Healthcare

**Information that may be of interest**:

- Disease presence (in the population, a subgroup, or an individual)
- Disease prognosis (in the population, a subgroup, or an individual) 
- Presence of risk factors
- Safety and effectiveness of an intervention
- Individualized treatment effects
- […]

## Data Science in Healthcare

Healthcare information is typically generated by conducting **dedicated studies** that are analyzed by (bio)statisticians

- Clinical trials

    - Safety and efficacy of new interventions

- Observational studies

    - Disease prevalence and incidence
    - Disease prognosis
    - Long-term safety

## Example 1

**WHO COVID1-9 Solidarity Therapeutics Trial**

- Study the effectiveness of treatments for COVID-19
- 14,200 hospitalized patients across 52 countries
- Randomized treatments under study:

    - Local standard of care
    - Artesunate (Ipca)
    - Imatinib (Novartis)
    - Infliximab (Johnson & Johnson)

- Primary outcome: in-hospital mortality

## Example 2

**The RECOVER initiative**

- Longitudinal cohort study
- Estimate long-term impact of COVID-19 in adults
- Identify risk factors and occurrence of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19
- Inclusion of 17,680 subjects with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection

## Real-world data

Increasingly often, researchers have access to large datasets that are labelled as “real-world data”

![](Picture 3.png){width=100% fig-align="center"}

## What is Real World Data (RWD) ?

Routinely collected data relating to a patient’s health status or the delivery of health care from a variety of sources other than traditional clinical trials  

- **Primary research data**
  
  (e.g., collected in the context of a prospective patient registry)  
- **Secondary research data**

  (e.g., electronic patient records data)

## Examples of real-world data

The **QRESEARCH** database

- Anonymised health records of over 35 million people from 1500 general practices spread throughout the UK
- Linkage to registries with information on death, cancer, hospital data, intensive care data, COVID-19 tests and vaccination
- <span style="color:blue;">https://www.qresearch.org</span>

## Examples of real-world data

**CALIBER**

- EHR data encompassing more than 10 million adults with 400 million person-years of follow-up
- Primary care consultations and hospitalizations
- Clinical examination findings, blood laboratory results,  prescriptions and vaccinations
- Diagnoses of diseases and mortality data

## Examples of real-world data

**CAPACITY**

- Registry of patients with COVID-19
- Collect information on cardiovascular history, diagnosis and occurrence of cardiovascular complications
- Data from >13000 patients from 72 centres across 13 countries

## Use of real-world data

## Use of real-world data

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
Real-world data are, for instance, used increasingly often in the lifecycle of medical interventions:

- **Pre-clinical development**: to explore and quantify the unmet medical need within a particular disease area (e.g., the number of patients with a particular condition, characterization of natural disease history). 
- **Clinical development**: to derive information on the current standard of care in different jurisdictions, thereby informing the design of clinical trials.

## Use of real-world data

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
Real-world data are, for instance, used increasingly often in the lifecycle of medical interventions: 

- **Market authorization**: to fast-track approval of new treatments, to address key public health issues (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic), to facilitate drug evaluation for rare diseases 
- **Health Technology Assessment**: inform policy decisions to ensure faster patient access
- **Policy makers**: inform clinical guidelines and shared decision making within clinical practice
:::

## Use of real-world data

Use of real-world data often requires additional efforts to

- Retrieve and prepare data (e.g., integration of relevant data sources)
- Identify data quality (e.g., coding errors, missing data, etc.)
- Address quality concerns (e.g., multiple imputation of missing data)
- Analyse the data (e.g., adjustment for sources of bias)
- Interpret results (e.g., need for sensitivity analyses)

## Considerations in EHRs for COVID-19 CER

## Example 1

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
**Development of the ISARIC 4C Deterioration model**

- Estimate risk of in-hospital deterioration in adults with COVID-19
- Based on data from >74,000 patients across 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales
- Inclusion of 11 predictors
  
  (age, sex, nosocomial infection, Glasgow coma scale score, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) at admission, breathing room air or oxygen therapy, respiratory rate, urea concentration, C-reactive protein concentration, lymphocyte count, and presence of radiographic chest infiltrates)

Does the model generalize outside the UK?

## Example 2

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
**Validation of 8 prediction models for COVID-19**

- Data from 46,914 patients across 18 countries
- Key issues

    - Data are located on different servers
    - Unavailability of some predictors in certain hospitals
    - Incomplete measurements (e.g., lab values)
    - Inaccurate timing of measurements (lack of “baseline”)
    - Heterogeneity between data sources
