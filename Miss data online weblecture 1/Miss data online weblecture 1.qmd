## Introduction

Study is completed:

- All patients measured
- Determinants/predictors/covariates/independent variables/X’n AND the outcome/dependent variable/Y
- Data in computer 
- Descriptive/frequency tables - MISSINGS

## Introduction

- MISSINGS = problems -> precision + validity
- TO PREVENT IS BETTER THAN TO CURE

## Introduction
::: {style="font-size: 0.85em"}
- Missing data always occur (any study):

    - retrospective and prospective 
    - existing (routine care) databases
    - large scale population-based 
    - (even!) well organised randomised trials

- Challenge: how proper analyses with missing values?

    - unbiased effect estimates (validity)
    - precise effect estimates (precision) 
:::

## Introduction

- Epidemiological analyses:

    - Association determinants (predictors/ covariates/confounders) with outcome
    - Multivariable (regression) analyses
    - What happens with participant record if one variable (X or Y) is missing?

- = complete case (CC) analyses 
- = most common
- = always affects precision effect estimates (not all data used)
- = commonly causes bias
:::

## Introduction

- Most (epidemiological) studies use complete case analysis or other methods to handle missings that cause bias.

- Type and severity bias depend on method used and type of missing data.

## Type of missing values

- 3 types: MCAR, MAR, MNAR

    - Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)
    - Missing At Random (MAR)
    - Missing Not At Random (MNAR)

## Type of missing values

- If MCAR holds, almost all analytical methods (see later) for handling missing data give unbiased results, although less precise

- Realistic?

    - Reason: missing related to other patient characteristics, including outcome (!!!)     
    - = MAR = missing at random

## Type of missing values

**2. Missing At Random (MAR)**

- Probability that an observation is missing depends only on other observed values (patient characteristics, including the outcome)

Most advanced methods to handle missing values under MAR yield less biased and more precise estimates -> see later 

## Type of missing values

**3. Missing Not At Random (MNAR)**

::: {style="font-size: 0.85em"}
- The probability that an observation is missing depends also on unobserved values.

- E.g. probability of missing on a variable depends on the true (but unknown) value of that variable itself 

- Examples

    - sexual preference 
    - income level (to estimate SES) 
        
          - higher levels values have larger probability of being missed than lower values
:::

## Type of missing values
::: {style="font-size: 0.9em"}
- Missing data seldom (if ever) MCAR

- MNAR = problems -> no general methods for properly dealing with MNAR data!

- Fortunately, most clinical problems MAR 

    - Methods to properly deal with them 

How to check likelihood of missing data being MCAR or rather MAR?

Next slide = very important table in empirical research!

## Testing for MCAR/MAR
::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
- Missing data CLEARLY not MCAR 

    - Analyzed subset of 246 subjects is not random subset of the original study sample (N=398) –> SELECTION bias due to missings
    - Missing related to other observed characteristics (incl. outcome)= MAR
    - If missingness related to observed characteristics – these can be used to estimate/predict the missing values!
    - Missing could still partly MNAR – but also MAR. Cannot test for MNAR – only reduce MNAR-part as much as possible by including many observed chars (increasing MAR)

Compare: adjustment for known confounders (MAR) versus residual confounders (MNAR)

- NOTE: if table shows no difference, does not mean indeed MCAR -> notably for missing outcomes in RCTs
