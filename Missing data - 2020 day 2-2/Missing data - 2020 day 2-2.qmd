## Methods to handle missing data
Simple methods (ad hoc)

Complete case analysis (CC)

Available case analysis (AC)

Missing indicator method

Overall mean/median imputation

Subgroup mean/median imputation

Single (multivariable) regression based imputation

**Multiple regression based imputation**


## Multiple imputation by regression

Key problem in SI: **all values are treated as observed**

However, imputations are uncertain

Remember:

- Uncertainty due to natural variation (imputed values are conditional mean values)
- Uncertainty of the estimated imputation model is ignored (the imputation model coefficients are treated as true)

SI cannot convey this uncertainty

## Multiple imputation by regression

Key change -> **multiple** imputation

**Univariate missingness**

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
- Estimate imputation model for the missing variable in the complete data
- For each patient with a missing value

    - Draw a random sample from estimated imputation model parameters (regression coefficients, residual error)
    - Use sampled parameters to generate prediction (solution to #2)
    - Add noise to the prediction (solution to #1)

- Repeat many times to generate many imputed data sets

Note imputed values change over imputed data sets and observed value don’t -> this conveys imputation uncertainty

Analysis as usual on complete data!


## Multiple imputation by regression

**Analysis and pool of the results**

- Study association (X’s on Y) in each of the *m* imputed (completed) data sets

- *m* beta’s of *X*’s on Y are averaged -> 1 beta per X 

- *m* SE’s per beta are “<span style="color:red;">pooled</span>” (via Rubin’s rules) -> accounting for between imputation variation -> yielding 1 SE per X

## Multiple imputation by regression

- Under M(C)AR: 

    - MI provides unbiased beta estimates (as SI)
    - Provides unbiased SEs (p-values) --> since properly accounting for the uncertainty surrounding the imputations

- Under MNAR: even when missing X’s or Y are partly MNAR, applying imputation methods that assume MAR can reduce bias based on the MAR part of the missing data mechanism

## Multiple imputation by regression

**Multivariate missingness**

Aforementioned approach is ineffective when we have patients with $>1$ missing value

- We can only use patients without missing values to estimate the imputation models
- Patients with missing values for $X_1$ may still inform imputation of $X_2$

Iterative procedures provide a solution (**see tomorrow**)

General recommendations

- **Imputations should properly reflect all uncertainty**

    - both the imputation model error component and the uncertainty on imputation model parameters

- **Imputation models should be as flexible as possible**

    - At least include the level of complexity necessary for the analysis model and mabye more (to the extend that other variables may also carry information on missing data)
    - Flexibility also relates to interactions and functional form in the analysis model (see Seaman et al. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-12-46)

## Imputation models should be as flexible as possible

More complex imputation models are possible

- Generalized additive models
- Neural networks
- Random forests
- …

## Common pitfalls of multiple imputation

Clearly described by Sterne et al. (doi: 10.1136/bmj.b2393)

- Omitting the outcome variable from the imputation procedure
- Dealing with non-normally distributed variables
- Plausibility of missing at random assumption
- Data that are missing not at random
- Computational problems

## Imputation (single or multiple) with or without outcome?

- Missingness on determinant commonly relates to other patient characteristics, including (directly or indirectly) the outcome
- Advice (SI + MI) = use *all* observed patient data, i.e. all other determinants (X’s) <span style="color:red;">plus</span> the outcome
- If the outcome is ignored during imputation, the association between the imputed predictor and outcome will evaporate
- This also relates to the congeniality problem (more on this tomorrow)

## Special case: handling missing outcomes (in RCTs or observational studies)
::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
When i) only outcome data is missing and ii) the analysis are based on maximum likelihood (which is very common):

- CCA with covariate adjustment yields unbiased estimates, of both betas and SEs, when:

    - missing outcome data are MAR, and 
    - All predictors of missingness (all covariates/confounders) of the outcome are included as covariates in the adjustment model  fully adjusted model!
    - Irrespective of the relations between the covariates and treatment (i.e., holds for RCTs and observational studies)
    - <span style="color:red;">No imputation needed!</span>

- <span style="color:red;">But</span>

    - MI allows also for incorporation of post-randomization variables (e.g. secondary endpoints, never included in adjusted model)
    - MI can handle simultaneously both missing outcome and predictors (which is common)
