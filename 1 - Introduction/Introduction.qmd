## Introduction

Strategies to allow borrowing of information

- Simultaneous approaches that define a multivariate distribution f(Y ) directly (‚Äú**joint modelling**‚Äù)

- Sequential approaches that build up a multivariate distribution using a ladder of conditional distributions, where the model for each variable conditions only on those earlier in the sequence (‚Äú**fully conditional specification**‚Äù)
