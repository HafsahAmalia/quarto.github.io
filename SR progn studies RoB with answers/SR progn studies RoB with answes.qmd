## RoB prognostic factor studies: QUIPS Tool

::: {style="font-size: 0.9em"}
- Domain-based evaluation + signaling questions/items

    - Follows QUADAS-2, ROBINS-I, RoB-2
    - Assessments made separately for different bias domains
    - Requires judgment/knowledge
    - Based on basic epidemiological principles

- Use of scales “explicitly discouraged”

    - Weighting of items difficult to justify
    - Often based on reporting rather than conduct
:::

## Risk of Bias tools

- Prognostic factor/predictor finding studies

    - QUIPS -> J Haydn, Ann Int Med 2006 + 2013

- Prediction model studies (development and validation)

    - PROBAST  – under review (2018)

## Practical

![](Picture 13.png){width=100% height=650}


## Suggested answers QUIPS practical

- Study Participation – MODERATE
- Study Attrition – LOW
- Prognostic Factor Measurement – MODERATE
- Outcome Measurement – LOW
- Covariate adjustment – LOW
- Statistical Analysis and Reporting - LOW

## Problems with risk of bias assessment

- Not as straightforward as it might sound
- Quality assessment is subjective 
- Hampered by poor reporting
- Poor reporting ≠ high risk of bias


## Summary: Risk of Bias Assessment using QUIPS

- Approach to assess potential biases in prognostic factor studies
- Requires operationalization of criteria a priori
- Requires judgments across items within domains
- Description of study methods supporting judgments

# Prediction Model Studies

## Risk of Bias tools

- Prognostic factor/predictor finding studies

    - QUIPS -> J Haydn, Ann Int Med 2006 + 2013

- Prediction model studies (development and validation)

    - PROBAST  – under review (2018)
    
## Prediction Modelling Studies

**Recall**

1. What were again the three phases of prediction modelling
2. What was the biggest difference between phase 1+2 versus 3?
3. What were the typical bias problems in prediction model studies – how do these exhibit themselves?


## Recall 3 Phases of Prediction Modelling studies

::: {style="font-size: 0.5em"}
**BMJ series 2009/Bouwmeester 2012/PROGRESS series 2013 (BMJ/Plos  Med)**
:::

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
1. Model development studies – to develop prediction model from data: identify important predictors; estimate predictor weights; construct model for individualised predictions; quantify predictive performance; internal validation

2. Model validation studies –  test (validate) predictive performance of previously developed model in participant data other than development set 

3. Model impact studies – quantify effect/impact actually using model on participant/physician management and health outcomes – relative to not using the model -> comparative studies.
:::

## Specific issue in Prediction Model studies

- Bias in prognostic model development exhibited by:

    - Overfitted models (too large ROC area, too optimistic calibration plot or outcome classification)
    - Wrong estimated predictor weights
    - Wrong estimated intercept

- Unfortunately: often don’t know from development study -> only visible until model validation -> ideally external 

## ...

Slope plot < 1.0

- Low prob too low
- High prob too high

## ...

- Systematic overestimation predicted probabilities
- Intercept (outcome incidence) development study too high!

## PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool)

## Structure of PROBAST

- Also domain-based: each with section risk of bias + applicability
- Follows QUADAS-2, ROBINS-I, ROB 2.0 tool

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
*Bias* occurs if systematic flaws or limitations in the design, conduct or analysis of a primary study distort the results. For the purpose of prediction modelling studies, we have defined *risk of bias* as the “likelihood that a prediction model leads to distorted predictive performance for its intended use in the targeted individuals”. The predictive performance is typically evaluated using calibration, discrimination, and (re)classification. 

*Applicability* refers to the extent to which the prediction model from the primary study matches your systematic review question, for example in terms of the participants, predictors or outcomes of interest

## Presentation of Risk of Bias


- ‘Risk of Bias’ table (transparent reporting)

Judge the specific domains for each study:

    - Low risk of bias
    - Moderate risk of bias
    - High risk of bias

- Provide complete descriptions from studies supporting judgments

## Incorporating Assessments into Analyses

- Not appropriate to ignore potential biases

- Trade-off between bias and precision

    - Including all eligible studies will produce a result with high precision
    - But results may be biased due to flaws

- Cautious analysis and interpretation

## Approaches to Include RoB Results in Analysis

- Restrict primary analysis to ONLY studies with low risk of bias (e.g. on all domains)

    - Threshold-type of approach (arbitrary)
    - Sensitivity analysis including higher risk studies

- Explore the impact of individual bias domains

    - Graphically according to risk of bias
    - Comparison of subgroups
