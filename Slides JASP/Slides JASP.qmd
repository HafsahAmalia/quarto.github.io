## Prognosis

Forecast of future outcomes in people with a particular health condition

- *What is the risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients?*
- *Does age affect the risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients?*
- *What is the risk of mortality for a particular COVID-19 patient?*

## Prognostic model studies are common

- $>350$ models for predicting cardiovascular disease
- $>200$ models for patients with coronavirus-2019
- $>100$ models for brain trauma patients
- $>100$ diabetes type 2 models
- $>60$ models for breast cancer prognosis

## Need for systematic reviews

- To review all existing prognostic models for a particular condition or outcome(s)
- To summarize the predictive performance of a particular prognostic model
- To review comparisons of competing prognostic models

## Key steps of a systematic review

1. Defining the review question 
2. Searching for eligible studies
3. Quantitative data extraction
4. Critical appraissal  
5. Meta-analysis

## Meta-analysis

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}

**Aim: to produce a weighted average**

A random effects meta-analysis approach is essential to allow for unexplained heterogeneity across studies, due to

- Publication bias
- Variation in study design & quality
- Variation in inclusion criteria
- Differences in treatments received during follow-up
- Different types of prognostic effect measures (e.g. odds ratio and hazard ratios)
- Different sets of adjustment factors

## Case study: Meta-analysis of EuroSCORE II

**Meta-analysis of the EuroSCORE II model**

23 published validation studies with (incomplete) information on:

- Model discrimination (c-statistic)
- Model calibration (O:E ratio)

Where possible, JASP will recover missing data from reported information.
