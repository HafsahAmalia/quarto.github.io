## Prediction

Estimate something that is yet unknown

- Presence of a certain disease (<span style="color:green;">diagnosis</span>)
- Future occurrence of a particular event (<span style="color:green;">prognosis</span>)

## Prediction

Study and modelling of prognostic factors

- Signs & symptoms
- Medical history
- Comorbidities
- Biomarkers
- …

## Need for systematic reviews

Abundance of prognosis studies, with poor understanding of

- The predictive and incremental value of novel risk factors
- The comparative performance of existing prediction models
- The clinical impact of available prediction models


**Systematic review and meta-analysis** may help to identify promising risk factors, multivariable models, to summarize their performance, and to evaluate the need for further improvements.

## Example of a prognosis review

**Primary objectives**

::: {style="font-size: 0.5em"}
To identify and summarize multivariable prognostic models for quantifying the risk of clinical disease progression, worsening, and activity in MS. 


To this end we will: 

- describe the characteristics of the identified multivariable prognostic models, including prognostic factors considered and evaluation measures used;
- describe changes in outcome definitions, time frames, prognostic factors and statistical methods over time; 
- qualitatively summarize the validation performance of the models;
- <span style="color:red;">summarize model performance</span> across external validation studies via meta-analysis, where possible; 
- assess the risk of bias in the models;
- evaluate moderating effects on model performance by meta-regression, where possible; and
- make recommendations for future MS prognostic research.

## Recommended steps

1. Formulating the review question
2. Formulating the search strategy
3. Data extraction
4. Critical appraissal 
5. Meta-analysis
6. Investigating heterogeneity across studies
7. Sensitivity analyses
8. Reporting

## Formulating the review question

Describe rationale, objectives, design, methodology and statistical considerations

## Critical appraisal

Assess risk of bias and applicability to the review question

- Prognostic factors: $QUIPS^1$
- Prognostic models: $PROBAST^2$

## Critical appraisal: an example

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
Systematic review of published prediction models in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis

Key issues identified using PROBAST:

- Exclusion or inappropriate imputation of participants with missing data
- Small sample size
- Lack of internal validation
- Many predictors required information unavailable at the time of diagnosis such as longitudinal disease course features

## Meta-analysis

Fixed effect meta-analysis

- The studied effect (e.g., risk factor association; prediction model performance) is identical across all studies
- Variation only appears due to chance

Random effects meta-analysis

- The studied effect differs across studies
- Variation arises from sampling error and between-study heterogeneity

## Meta-analysis

## Meta-analysis

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
Risk factor associations and prediction model performance tend to vary across studies due to differences in study characteristics & quality, participant eligibility criteria, length of follow-up, treatments received, analysis methods, etc.

- A random effects approach is essential to identify unexplained heterogeneity and obtain more conservative standard errors
- A prediction interval may help to describe potential impact of heterogeneity, and provides a range for the true prognostic effect (or prediction model’s performance) in a new study population
- Meta-regression can be applied to investigate the impact of study-level variables on heterogeneity

## Closing remarks

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
Many similarities to other types of meta-analysis, however,

- Data extraction more difficult
- Heterogeneity more common
- Summary estimates less meaningful

Need to focus more on

- Quantifying between-study heterogeneity
- Assessing sources of variability in model performance

**Meta-analysis of individual participant data** can resolve many issues
