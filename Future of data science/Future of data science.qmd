## Background

With recent advances in the collection of real-world data (RWD), there is a growing demand to leverage real-world evidence (RWE) in decision making

\
**Focus of today**

- Investigation of treatment effectiveness in real-world settings

## Background

- RWE is increasingly recognised as being complementary to clinical trials in comparative effectiveness research 
- The regulatory acceptance of RWE presents a challenge to other healthcare decision-makers for use of RWD
- Methodological advances addressing limitations of RWD have not been widely applied in healthcare decision making
- Lack of methodological frameworks has been widely recognised as a major cause of the low uptake of cross study design in decision making.

## What are non-randomized studies?

- Source of Real-World Data
- Observational studies where the assignment of patients to a therapeutic product is not determined by a trial protocol
- Diagnostic or monitoring procedures represent routine clinical practice

NRS data can be collected either prospectively or retrospectively by observation in routine clinical practice, and can be analysed using epidemiological (biostatistical) methods.

## Comparative effectiveness research using NRS

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
**Aim**: to enable the trustworthy generation of results from combining NRS and RCT data. We provided recommendations on how to:

1. appraise the quality of NRS evidence
2. select the most reliable NRS evidence for a quantitative analysis with RCTs, and 
3. appropriately use of various statistical approaches.

**Development**: a multi-methods approach (systematic reviews, Delphi survey, snowballing approach^)

## Step 5: selecting the analytical scenario

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
NRS results should only be pooled with RCT data if:

- Existing RCTs have important limitations

  (e.g. sample size, high risk of bias, low applicability/relevance)
- NRS do not have high risk of bias
  
  (e.g. as assessed by ROBINS-I)
- NRS do not have low applicability

- *This approach differs from that recommended in RCTs meta-analyses, where low-quality studies are usually only excluded in a sensitivity analysis.*
:::


## Step 5: selecting the analytical scenario

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
Framework recommends to select among 3 analytical scenarios according to:

- Clinical context (‘relevance or applicability’)
- Completeness of RCT data (‘evidence gaps’)
- Magnitude and direction of possible biases of NRS 

  (‘rigour or quality of effect estimates’).

- The scenarios are directly linked to the framework described by Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy (<span style="color:blue;">https://healthpolicy.duke.edu/projects/real-world-evidence-collaborative</span>).

## Key issues for meta-analysis

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
When summarizing results from multiple studies, consider:

- Differences in study precision 
  
  (e.g. reflected by standard error)
- Differences in risk of bias & applicability
  
  (e.g. due to inclusion of NRS)
- Differences in treatment effect
  
  (e.g. due to presence of study effects)

\

- Adjustment requires implementation of advanced meta-analysis methods. 
- We recommend to first summarize results from RCTs and NRS separately.
:::

## High-evidence bar situation

**When: RCTs are preferred source of inference**

- Treat the NRS data as prior evidence for the RCT analyses
- Apply bias corrections to individual NRS results 

  (e.g. direct, elicited consensus, or credibility ceiling correction)
- Restrict the contribution of non-randomized evidence by decreasing their precision
  
  (e.g. if there is risk of bias, or between-study heterogeneity)

## Medium-evidence bar situation

**When to use?**

- Evidence from RCTs and NRS are considered equally relevant
- Evidence from RCTs and NRS is different but related 

![](Picture 13.png){width=100%}

## Medium-evidence bar situation

- Adoption of multilevel meta-analysis models
- Design-specific estimates of treatment effect
- Design-specific estimates of between-study heterogeneity
- Estimates from each study can be adjusted by shifting the mean and/or inflating the variance
- The overall treatment effect is pulled towards the results from large, homogeneous studies that share a common design.

## Low-evidence bar situation

**When: NRS are the preferred source of inference with high applicability**

- Apply bias corrections to individual NRS results 

  (e.g. direct, elicited consensus, or credibility ceiling correction)
- Perform data-driven bias adjustments

  (e.g. incorporation of bias models)

## Step 6: Examining heterogeneity

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
Heterogeneity is likely to be present in synthesis of RCTs and NRS, and therefore should be explored:

- Explicitly distinguish between evidence from 
  
  RCTs and NRS
- Allow for random effects, and estimate their variance
- Quantify heterogeneity 
  
  (e.g. I2, prediction intervals)
- Explore sources of treatment effect heterogeneity
  
  (e.g. using meta-regression, or by modelling patient-level data)
:::

## Step 7: Interpretation of effect estimates

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
Important to consider:

- The **quality** of the included studies (both RCTs and NRS)
- The **robustness** of adopted analytical methods
- The **results** of any sensitivity analyses

\

- Random-effects summary estimates may be of limited value in the presence of substantial heterogeneity
- Use prediction intervals to explore impact on decision making

## Case study: treatments for COVID-19

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
- Over 500 million confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported globally
- Serious cases of COVID-19 typically require treatment in a secondary care setting
- Healthcare payers want to ensure that treatments being used for COVID-19 represent an efficient use of resources. Two treatment options include

    - the JAK inhibitor, baricitinib
    - the IL-6 receptor inhibitor, tocilizumab

\
Since healthcare providers will face an “either-or” decision about these two treatments, it is important to understand their comparative effectiveness.

## Case study: treatments for COVID-19

Early evidence on treatments for COVID-19

- RECOVERY trial
- Solidarity trial
- “living'' meta-analyses 

\
Observational data could be collected more quickly and provide timely insights for decision making. 

## Case study: treatments for COVID-19

European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) <span style="color:blue;">https://www.ehden.eu</span>

- RWD from primary and secondary care
- Linkage to biobanks (e.g. UK Biobank), laboratory test data (e.g. Catalan central registry of COVID-19 PCR tests), national audits (e.g. UK National Audit of Intensive Care Units)
- Mapping to OMOP Common Data Model (version 5)

## Case study: treatments for COVID-19

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em"}
**Aim**: to estimate treatment effects for COVID-19 treatments using data from the EHDEN network and to combine these observational results with data from randomised studies.

\
**Primary objectives**:

- To assess comparative effectiveness and safety among Tocilizumab and Baricitinib in hospitalised patients
- To assess comparative effectiveness and safety among Aspirin and Heparin in hospitalised patients
