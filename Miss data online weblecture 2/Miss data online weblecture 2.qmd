## Methods to handle missing data

**Complete case analysis (CC)**

**Available case analysis (AC)**

**Missing indicator method**

**Overall mean/median imputation**

**Subgroup mean/median imputation**

**Single (multivariable) regression based imputation**

**Multiple regression based imputation**


## Methods to handle missing data

**Complete case analysis (CC)**

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
- Base analyses on the subset of completely observed subjects 

- If MCAR (though seldom): 

    - less precision
    - valid results 

- If MAR (as usual in medicine):

    - Efficiency loss
    - (Very) biased (see papers on black board/ references at end)
:::

## Complete case

- Example 1 (above): 
- Missing PH+PE in sicker subjects -> biased predictive value of PE+PH predictors (over- or underestimated)
- Missing lab tests in healthy subjects -> biased predictive value of lab predictors

## Complete case

- Example 2 (above):
- Mean outcome (or % events) in placebo group selectively (!) lower -> RR too close to 1 (if Ry effective)

## Complete case

- How about correlation and regression? 

- Since, in theory, with good correlation (r=1) r indeed same even if (e.g.) all higher values not available -> same regression line

- Correlation coefficients indeed more robust when MAR, but not immune (‘due to restriction of range’):

- Sometimes possible to redefine study population to get complete cases:

    - E.g. missings mainly before 1980; study population becomes ‘all subjects after 1980’

- CC = in fact redefinition of study and thus source population (domain)

    - E.g. missings in specific hospital/country -> study population becomes ‘all subjects in completely observed hospitals/countries’
    - E.g. missing outcomes in RCTs -> ‘Results apply to patients who with complete f-up’ -> is this a solution?

## Methods to handle missing data
Simple methods (ad hoc)

**Complete case analysis (CC)**

**Available case analysis (AC)**

**Missing indicator method**

**Overall mean/median imputation**

**Subgroup mean/median imputation**

**Single (multivariable) regression based imputation**

**Multiple regression based imputation**

## ...

**Available case analysis (AC)**

- Use in each (sub-)analysis all cases with complete data on the variables involved (in the model).
- Most used method in practice
- In general AC more efficient than CC since most of the time more data will be used!
- Is this a problem?

## Answer

- Number of subjects is different for each sub-analysis; this may cause interpretation problems or even estimation problems

    - prediction model comparisons on different subjects
      
        - Added value estimates wrong

## Available case

- Problems with MCAR + MAR similar as CC

    - Unbiased if MCAR ; biased if MAR
    - Bias sometimes smaller than CC; sometimes larger

## Indicator method

- originally developed for etiologic analysis with missing confounder information ->
- to allow for analysis of all subjects on the determinant at interest

## Indicator method

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
- Method developed for etiologic research for (partially) missing confounder data
- To allow for using all data on the determinant of interest in the analysis (not loosing power)
- But: 

    - $b_{10}$ is not adjusted for gender, so potentially biased
    - Consequently, b1 potentially biased…
    - Due to mutually adjustment b2 also biased
    - and $b_0$ is biased --> very important in prediction research (intercept)
    - Everything is biased
:::

## Indicator method

- Indicator method smaller SE’s than  CC or AC
- Many consider indicator method valid but gives biased results;

    - even when MCAR holds!!!!!
    - limited relevance to practice – indicator often significantly related to outcome – unhandy message for prediction research (‘do not measure this variable’)

## Imputation

- Imputation is replacement – best method!!

- Missing observations are replaced by ‘predicted’ values (‘best guesses’), based on observed data 

    - can be done if MAR!!!!

## Overall mean/median imputation

- What is it?

- What are the consequences and disadvantages?

## Answer

- For each missing on variable Z overall mean from observed subject-values imputed

    - Diseased + non-diseased together

- All imputations have same value for Z

    - Distributions of Z for D+ and D- will merge/less overlap
    - Association of Z on outcome dilutes = bias
    - Also: distribution of Z becomes too narrow (SD too low)

        - SE’s of Z underestimated -> too often significant

ALWAYS: ALSO IF MCAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## Subgroup mean/median imputation

- What is it?
- Why better than overall mean/median imputation?
- What are the consequences/disadvantages?

## Subgroup mean imputation

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
- A priori relevant subgroups are defined  based on associations with variable (Z) with missings

    - E.g. per outcome category, sex, age groups, etc.

- Estimate mean/median for subgroup

    - For each missing on Z  subgroup mean is imputed 

- More variations in imputed values than overall mean/median

    - Less bias though SE’s still underestimated
    - Limited number of co-variates can a-priori be defined
    - Requires categorisation for continuous variables (loss of information)
