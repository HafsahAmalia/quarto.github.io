## Imputation via Fully Conditional Specification

::: {style="font-size: 0.7em"}
**Two situations**

- 1 missing covariate

    - Straightforward implementation
    - No Gibbs sampler needed
    - Try this at home!

- $>1$ missing covariate

    - Implementation more complicated
    - Requires a Gibbs sampler
    - Implemented by numerous software packages

## > 1 covariate missing

We need to estimate an imputation model for each missing covariate. However, 

- Subjects typically have one or more missing observations => the complete dataset may be too small for estimating the imputation models!
- Subjects with complete data may differ from subjects with one or more missing observations
- **How to use information from subjects with partially observed data?**

## > 1 covariate missing

Each imputation model needs to be estimated using imputed data! Similar to imputation via Joint Modelling, this requires the implementation of a Gibbs sampler.

## Imputation via Fully Conditional Specification

**How to implement imputation via FCS?**

- The R package “mice” offers many methods.

  Extensions for multilevel data have been implemented in the R package “micemd”

- Many other packages are available, see

  https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MissingData.html
  

## Imputation via Fully Conditional Specification

**Key issues**

- The conditional distributions should be compatible (that is, they should describe a joint distribution)

  This will be discussed in the next lecture
